# gonano

__gonano__ is a __WIP__ implementation of the Nano cryptocurrency in Go.

This is a work in progress. Do not use this in production environments. All of
the exported API's are subject to change and should thus not be considered
stable. The same applies to the database format, configuration files and wallet
files.
